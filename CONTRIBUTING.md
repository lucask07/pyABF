## Development Environment Setup

When working with Python projects I prefer the [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install the latest version of Python from https://python.org

In a terminal, `cd` into this repository's top-level folder

Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`

Activate the virtual environment: `"env/Scripts/activate"`

Install the required packages: `pip install -r "src/requirements.txt"`

## Running Tests

In a terminal, `cd` into this repository's top-level folder

Activate the virtual environment: `"env/Scripts/activate"`

Run the tests: `pytest`
